## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

in this project I did not use anything fancy. just the vanilla HTML,CSS JavaScript.
i used PDFjs library to generate the pdf file after finalizing the schedual.
and HTML2Canvas to take screenshot of the plan after finishing it

## Optimizations

the plan is hard coded. I plan in the future to make it that it would accept the data and generate the site of the needed major. 

add prerequisites and corequisites to each course.

making the pdf file more appealing. 
## Lessons Learned:

one of the major learning outcome of this project was learning and using CSS-grid as its a powerful tool that made making this project easier.
using pdfjs was another outcome of this project.
